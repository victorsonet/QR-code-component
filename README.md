## Overview

### Screenshot

![](./design/screenshot.png)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

1. Used flexbox on main I can center the sections
2. Gave a background of white to both sections
3. Defined the width of the qr section but the picture this way moved so I had to make the qr section flex as well and center the image
4. The image got 95% width so there is a white outline
5. Defined the border radiuses
6. Gave the same width to the content section as well
7. Finished the rest of the styling

### Continued development

At first I used pixels then I was like this is not right and I started to use percentages so both flex and width needs more experience.

### Useful resources

Tried to figure it out by myself.
