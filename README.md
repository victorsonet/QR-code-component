## Overview

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

1. Used flexbox on main I can center the sections
2. Gave a background of white to both sections
3. Defined the width of the qr section but the picture this way moved so I had to make the qr section flex as well and center the image
4. The image got 95% width so there is a white outline
5. Defined the border radiuses
6. Gave the same width to the content section as well
7. Finished the rest of the styling

### Continued development

At first I used pixels then I was like this is not right and I started to use percentages so both flex and width needs more experience.

### Useful resources

Tried to figure it out by myself.
